#Oblique

Think more laterally.

Slack bot that returns a randomly-selected [Oblique Strategy](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/Ed1.html) along with a link to a random [I Ching](http://www.akirarabelais.com/i/i.html) hexagram. Randomness courtesy of [random.org](http://random.org), for which you will want to get an [API key](https://api.random.org/api-keys).

Now also returns a random Strategy to the web as text at /strategy (for example at [my Heroku instance](https://pedicel-oblique.herokuapp.com/strategy))
